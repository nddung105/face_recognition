# Face Recognition Project
###

Implementation of the MTCNN face detector and FaceNet. The project uses model from the paper ["Joint Face Detection and Alignment using
Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878) and ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832)
