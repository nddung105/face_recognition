# Face Recognition Project
###

Implementation of the MTCNN face detector and FaceNet. The project uses model from the papers:
 - ["Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878)
 - ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832)
