# Face Recognition Project
###

Implementation of the MTCNN face detector and FaceNet. The project uses model from the papers:
 - ["Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878)
 - ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832)

It is written from scratch, using as a reference the implementation of MTCNN and FaceNet from David Sandberg ([FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/)) in Facenet.
